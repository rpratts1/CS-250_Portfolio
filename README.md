##  Overview  
This repository contains my coursework and portfolio artifacts for **CS-250: Software Development Life Cycle** at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  
Throughout this course, I learned how Agile and Scrum improve software development by focusing on teamwork, communication, and small increments of working software.

This portfolio includes my:
- Sprint Review and Retrospective  
- Agile Presentation Slides  
- Written reflections on software development methods  
- Examples of communication in different Scrum roles  
- Project artifacts from discussions, assignments, and team simulations  
Note: The CS-250 Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable is included in this repository and is directly linked below for easy access.

##  Agile & Scrum Experience  
During this course, I took on multiple Scrum roles, including:

### **Product Owner**
- Created user stories and acceptance criteria  
- Managed and refined the product backlog  
- Explained the product vision and customer needs  

### **Scrum Master**
- Facilitated Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective  
- Supported the team by removing blockers  
- Encouraged teamwork, transparency, and continuous improvement  

### **Developer**
- Broke down user stories into smaller tasks  
- Helped deliver working software in small increments  
- Practiced estimation techniques such as T-Shirt Sizing  

### **Tester**
- Wrote test ideas based on acceptance criteria  
- Practiced Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles  
- Provided fast feedback to improve software quality  

These experiences helped me understand how Agile teams work together to deliver value.
